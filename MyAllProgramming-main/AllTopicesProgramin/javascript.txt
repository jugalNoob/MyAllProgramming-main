Data Types:

Number: Represents numeric values, both integers and floating-point numbers.
String: Represents a sequence of characters, such as text.
Object: A complex data type that can store multiple values as properties or methods.
Null: Represents the intentional absence of any object or value.
Undefined: Represents a variable that has been declared but hasn't been assigned a value.
Boolean: Represents true or false values.
Logical Operators:

|| (OR): Returns true if at least one operand is true.
&& (AND): Returns true if all operands are true.
Comparison Operators: Used to compare values, like == (equal), != (not equal), >, <, etc.
Functions:


Operators:

Arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /, %).
Comparison operators (==, ===, !=, !==, >, <).
Logical operators (&&, ||, !).
Ternary (conditional) operator.


const: A keyword used to declare constants.
Function: Declares a function.
await: Used in asynchronous code to pause execution until a Promise is resolved.
anonymous function: A function without a name.
async function: A function that returns a Promise.
generator function: A special type of function used to create iterable sequences.
callback function: A function passed as an argument to another function.
Function Composition in Jvacript
static callback function: Often used in object-oriented programming.
Array Methods:

Various methods for manipulating arrays, such as push, pop, splice, slice, etc.
String Methods:

String manipulation methods like split, slice, search, replace, etc.
If-Else Statements:

Conditional statements in programming to make decisions.
Looping:

Control structures for repeating a block of code, including for, while, do-while, etc.
Currying: A technique in functional programming where a function with multiple arguments is transformed into a series of functions each taking a single argument.

Object Class: Possibly referring to object-oriented programming classes and objects.

Math Methods: Functions for mathematical operations like random and floor.

Time Date: Handling date and time in programming.

ES6: Refers to ECMAScript 2015, which introduced many new features to JavaScript.

JSON: JavaScript Object Notation for data interchange, with methods like JSON.stringify and JSON.parse.

LocalStorage/SessionStorage/Cookies: Web storage and cookie mechanisms for storing data on the client-side.

Window: Methods for interacting with the browser window, such as alert, prompt, confirm.

Debounce/Throttle: Techniques to control the frequency of function execution in response to an event.

Closures: Functions that "remember" the environment in which they were created.

Objects: General concept of objects in programming.

Set/Map: Data structures used to store collections of values.

Apply/Call/Bind: Methods used to manipulate the context of function execution in JavaScript.

Timeout/TimeInterval: Functions for delaying execution or repeatedly running code.
